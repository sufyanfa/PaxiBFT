Introduction (pbft)
msg.go This file defines the message types and structures used in the PBFT protocol, including requests, pre-prepares, prepares, commits, and acknowledgments. It ensures consistent message handling and serialization for effective communication among replicas.
pbft.go This file implements the PBFT consensus algorithm, managing the overall operation of the protocol. It coordinates message flow, initiates consensus processes, and handles state transitions between different phases of PBFT.
replica.go This file represents a PBFT replica, encapsulating its behavior and functionalities. It processes incoming messages, manages local state updates, and responds to client requests, allowing replicas to actively participate in the consensus process.
File: msg.go
Overview
The msg.go file is integral to the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol, serving as the foundation for message handling and communication between replicas. It defines the essential message types used in the protocol, ensuring that they are appropriately structured and can be serialized for efficient transmission.
Package Declaration
package pbft
This line declares that the file belongs to the pbft package, which is responsible for implementing the PBFT protocol.
Imports
import (
	"encoding/gob"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/salemmohammed/PaxiBFT"
)
encoding/gob: Provides support for encoding and decoding data in Go's binary format, allowing for efficient serialization of messages.
fmt: Offers formatted I/O functions for outputting strings and other types.
github.com/salemmohammed/PaxiBFT: Imports the PaxiBFT package, which contains fundamental types and structures used within the PBFT implementation.
Initialization Function
func init() {
	gob.Register(PrePrepare{})
	gob.Register(Prepare{})
	gob.Register(Commit{})
}
The init function registers the message types (PrePrepare, Prepare, and Commit) with the gob encoder/decoder. This registration is essential for the correct serialization and deserialization of these types when communicating between replicas.
Message Types
PrePrepare Message
type PrePrepare struct {
    Ballot      PaxiBFT.Ballot
    ID          PaxiBFT.ID
    View        PaxiBFT.View
    Slot        int
    Request     PaxiBFT.Request
    Digest      []byte
    ActiveView  bool
    Command     PaxiBFT.Command
}


Description: The PrePrepare structure represents the first message in the PBFT consensus process. It contains information about the proposed command, the ballot number, the view of the system, and a digest of the command.
Fields:
Ballot: The current ballot being proposed.
ID: The identifier of the replica sending the message.
View: The current view number of the system.
Slot: The index slot for the request.
Request: The original request from the client.
Digest: A hash digest of the request, ensuring integrity.
ActiveView: A boolean indicating if the view is active.
Command: The command associated with the request.
String Representation:
func (m PrePrepare) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("PrePrepare {Ballot=%v , View=%v, slot=%v, Command=%v}", m.Ballot,m.View,m.Slot,m.Command)
}
This method provides a formatted string representation of the PrePrepare message, which is useful for debugging and logging.
Prepare Message

type Prepare struct {
    Ballot      PaxiBFT.Ballot
    ID          PaxiBFT.ID
    View        PaxiBFT.View
    Slot        int
    Digest      []byte
    Command     PaxiBFT.Command
    Request     PaxiBFT.Request
}


Description: The Prepare structure is used to signal that a replica is ready to commit a proposal. It confirms the receipt of a PrePrepare message and includes the necessary information to ensure agreement among replicas.
Fields:
Ballot, ID, View, Slot, Digest, Command, and Request: Similar to the PrePrepare structure but indicate readiness to proceed with the consensus.
String Representation:


func (m Prepare) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Prepare {Ballot=%v, ID=%v, View=%v, slot=%v, command=%v}", m.Ballot,m.ID,m.View,m.Slot,m.Command)
}
This method provides a string representation of the Prepare message.
Commit Message

type Commit struct {
    Ballot      PaxiBFT.Ballot
    ID          PaxiBFT.ID
    View        PaxiBFT.View
    Slot        int
    Digest      []byte
    Command     PaxiBFT.Command
    Request     PaxiBFT.Request
}


Description: The Commit structure is sent by replicas to indicate that a decision has been reached and that the command can be executed. It is crucial for finalizing the consensus process.
Fields: Same as the Prepare message, confirming the completion of the consensus process.
String Representation:


func (m Commit) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("Commit {Ballot=%v, ID=%v, View=%v, Slot=%v, command=%v}", m.Ballot,m.ID,m.View,m.Slot, m.Command)
}
This method returns a string representation of the Commit message.


File: replica.go
Overview
The replica.go file implements the Replica structure, which represents a single node within the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus protocol. This file handles the reception of requests, manages state transitions, and coordinates message handling for the PBFT process. The Replica structure plays a crucial role in ensuring that all nodes reach consensus on the execution of commands.

Replica Structure

type Replica struct {
	PaxiBFT.Node
	*Pbft
}

The Replica struct embeds the Node structure from the PaxiBFT package and contains a pointer to the Pbft structure. This allows the Replica to utilize the node functionalities while implementing the PBFT protocol.
Constructor

func NewReplica(id PaxiBFT.ID) *Replica {
	r := new(Replica)

	r.Node = PaxiBFT.NewNode(id)
	r.Pbft = NewPbft(r)

	r.Register(PaxiBFT.Request{}, r.handleRequest)
	r.Register(PrePrepare{}, r.HandlePre)
	r.Register(Prepare{}, r.HandlePrepare)
	r.Register(Commit{}, r.HandleCommit)

	return r
}

Description: The NewReplica function creates and initializes a new Replica instance.
Parameters:
id: The identifier of the replica.
Functionality:
Initializes the embedded Node and Pbft instances.
Registers handlers for different message types, ensuring that the replica can respond appropriately to incoming requests.
Handle Request

func (p *Replica) handleRequest(m PaxiBFT.Request) {
	log.Debugf("<---------------------handleRequest------------------------->")

	p.slot++ // slot number for every request
	if p.slot%1000 == 0 {
		fmt.Print("p.slot", p.slot)
	}

Description: This method processes incoming requests and updates the internal state of the replica.
Functionality:
Increments the slot number for each request received.
Logs the current slot number at intervals of 1000 for monitoring purposes.

	e, ok := p.log[p.slot]
	if !ok {
		p.log[p.slot] = &entry{
			ballot:    p.ballot,
			view:      p.view,
			command:   m.Command,
			commit:    false,
		    active:    false,
			Leader:    false,
			request:   &m,
			timestamp: time.Now(),
			Digest:    GetMD5Hash(&m),
			Q1:        PaxiBFT.NewQuorum(),
			Q2:        PaxiBFT.NewQuorum(),
			Q3:        PaxiBFT.NewQuorum(),
			Q4:        PaxiBFT.NewQuorum(),
		}
	}
	e = p.log[p.slot]
	e.command = m.Command
	e.request = &m

State Management:
Retrieves the log entry for the current slot. If it does not exist, a new entry is created, initializing various fields like ballot, view, command, and others.
Updates the command and request for the current log entry.

	log.Debugf("p.slot = %v ", p.slot)
	log.Debugf("Key = %v ", m.Command.Key)
	if e.commit {
		log.Debugf("Executed")
		p.exec()
	}
	if p.slot == 0 {
		fmt.Println("-------------------PBFT-------------------------")
	}

Logging: Logs the current slot and command key, helping trace the flow of requests and their handling.

	Node_ID := PaxiBFT.ID(strconv.Itoa(1) + "." + strconv.Itoa(1))
	log.Debugf("Node_ID = %v", Node_ID)
	if Node_ID == p.ID() {
		e.active = true
	}
	if e.active {
		log.Debugf("The view leader : %v ", p.ID())
		e.Leader = true
		p.ballot.Next(p.ID())
		p.view.Next(p.ID())
		p.requests = append(p.requests, &m)
		p.Pbft.HandleRequest(m, p.slot)
	}

Leader Election:
Checks if the replica is the leader for the current view and marks it as active.
Updates the ballot and view, and adds the request to the replicaâ€™s request queue.

	e.Rstatus = RECEIVED
	if e.Cstatus == COMMITTED && e.Pstatus == PREPARED && e.Rstatus == RECEIVED {
		e.commit = true
		p.exec()
	}
}

Commit Logic:
Updates the status of the request and checks if the entry is ready to be committed. If all conditions are met, the command is executed.
